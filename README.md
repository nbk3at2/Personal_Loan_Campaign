# Personal_Loan_Campaign
## Context
AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).
A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio.
You as a Data scientist at AllLife bank have to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
## Objective
To predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans, to understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and to identify which segment of customers to target more.
### Solution Approach
* To extract actionable insights from the data that AllLife Bank has collected to identify key areas of focus
* Perform EDA on Variables that influence the personal loan sales
* Build a Decision Tree Model using CART algorithms by training the model and to maximize the performance so that we can predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans
* Summarize the business recommendations for the bankâ€™s marketing department
